# School_District_Analysis

## Overview 

The school board has notified Maria and her supervisor that the 
"students_complete.csv" file shows evidence of academic dishonesty;
specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School 9th graders
appear to have been altered.  Although the school board does not know the full 
extent of the academic dishonesty, they want to uphold state-testing standards 
and have turned to Maria for help. She has asked me to replace the math and reading
scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact.
Once i’ve replaced the math and reading scores, Maria would like me to repeat the 
school district analysis that I did in this module and write up a report to describe
how these changes affected the overall analysis.

The Data needed to be checked, and corrected for irregularities in several fields, noteably the "student_name" column, as there were several anomolous entries related to name prefixes and suffixes, most likely due to cheeky students with a sense of humor.

### Results:
